# Glossary of Physical AI Terms

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the Physical AI book.

- **Action**: In ROS 2, a long-running, goal-oriented communication mechanism with feedback.
- **Actuator**: A component of a machine that is responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism or system.
- **AI-Robot Brain**: Refers to the intelligent software and algorithms enabling a robot's cognitive functions, often integrating perception, planning, and learning.
- **Digital Twin**: A virtual representation of a physical object or system, used for simulation, analysis, and monitoring.
- **Docker**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
- **Gazebo**: A powerful 3D robotics simulator.
- **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**: A specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images, crucial for AI/ML.
- **Humanoid Robot**: A robot designed to resemble the human body, particularly its form and movements.
- **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: An electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the orientation of the body.
- **Isaac ROS**: A collection of hardware-accelerated packages for ROS 2, leveraging NVIDIA GPUs.
- **Isaac Sim**: NVIDIA's scalable robotics simulation application and development environment built on Omniverse.
- **LiDAR**: A remote sensing method that uses pulsed laser to measure distances to objects.
- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: A type of AI model capable of understanding and generating human-like text, often used in robotics for high-level task planning.
- **Node**: In ROS 2, a process that performs computation, forming the basic unit of execution.
- **Perception Pipeline**: A series of processing steps to extract meaningful information from sensor data for a robot.
- **Physical AI**: A branch of AI focused on intelligent systems that interact with the physical world, often embodied in robots.
- **rclpy**: The Python client library for ROS 2.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: An area of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.
- **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: A flexible framework for writing robot software.
- **Robot Operating System (ROS)**: A set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications.
- **Sensor**: A device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment.
- **SDF (Simulation Description Format)**: An XML format for describing objects and environments for robot simulators like Gazebo.
- **Synthetic Data**: Data generated artificially, often used for training AI models when real-world data is scarce.
- **Topic**: In ROS 2, a named bus over which nodes exchange messages, enabling asynchronous communication.
- **Unity**: A real-time 3D development platform often used for high-fidelity Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) visuals.
- **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML format for describing robots in a way that is easily parsed by software.
- **VLA (Vision-Language-Action)**: A pipeline that integrates visual perception, natural language understanding (often via LLMs), and robotic action execution.
- **Whisper**: An OpenAI model for robust speech recognition, used to convert spoken language into text.
