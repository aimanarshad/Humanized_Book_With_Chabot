# Hardware Considerations for Physical AI

This chapter outlines essential hardware considerations for developing and deploying Physical AI systems, with a focus on humanoid robotics.

## Robotic Platforms

### Humanoid Robots

[Discuss general characteristics and requirements for humanoid robots in the context of Physical AI.]

### Key Components

- **Actuators**: Motors, servos, and other mechanisms for movement.
- **Sensors**: Cameras (RGB, Depth, Stereo), LiDAR, IMUs, force sensors, tactile sensors.
- **Embedded Systems / Single Board Computers (SBCs)**: NVIDIA Jetson series (Orin Nano, Xavier), Raspberry Pi, etc.

## Processing Units

### GPUs for AI/ML

[Explain the importance of GPUs for accelerated AI/ML computations, especially for perception, planning, and simulation.]

### CPUs for Control

[Discuss the role of CPUs for real-time control, ROS 2 node management, and general-purpose computing.]

## Development Hardware

### Workstations

[Recommendations for development workstations capable of running simulations and training models.]

### Cloud Resources

[Briefly discuss the use of cloud-based GPUs for more intensive training or large-scale simulations.]

## Connectivity and Communication

### Network Requirements

[Discuss network bandwidth, latency, and reliability for robot-to-controller communication and cloud connectivity.]

### ROS 2 Hardware Abstraction

[Explain how ROS 2 abstracts hardware details, allowing for flexible integration of different robotic components.]

## Power Management

[Considerations for battery life, power consumption, and thermal management in mobile and humanoid robots.]
