# Software Stack for Physical AI

This chapter details the software stack essential for building and operating Physical AI systems, covering robotics frameworks, AI/ML tools, simulation environments, and development utilities.

## Robotics Frameworks

### ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)

[Explain the role of ROS 2 as the central nervous system for robot software, covering nodes, topics, services, actions, and client libraries (rclpy, rclcpp).]

## Simulation Environments

### Gazebo

[Describe Gazebo as a powerful 3D robotics simulator, its use of SDF/URDF, and sensor plugins.]

### NVIDIA Isaac Sim

[Explain Isaac Sim as a scalable robotics simulation application and development environment, highlighting its capabilities for synthetic data generation and RL training.]

### Unity (for HRI)

[Discuss Unity's role in creating high-fidelity Human-Robot Interaction visuals and its potential integration with simulation frameworks.]

## Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning

### Large Language Models (LLMs)

[Explain how LLMs are used for high-level planning, natural language understanding, and decision-making in robotics.]

### Speech Recognition (Whisper)

[Describe speech recognition technologies like Whisper for converting spoken commands into text instructions for robots.]

### Perception Libraries

[Discuss libraries and frameworks for computer vision (e.g., OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch) used for object detection, segmentation, and environment understanding.]

### Reinforcement Learning Frameworks

[Introduce RL frameworks (e.g., Stable Baselines3, Ray RLlib) for training intelligent agents.

## Development Tools & Utilities

### Docker

[Explain the importance of Docker for creating reproducible development and deployment environments.]

### Version Control (Git/GitHub)

[Discuss Git for collaborative development and GitHub for code hosting and CI/CD.]

### IDEs and Editors

[Recommend suitable IDEs (e.g., VS Code) for robotics and AI development.]

### Docusaurus

[Describe Docusaurus as the static site generator used for the book's documentation.]
