# Feature Tasks: Introduction to Physical AI

**Feature Branch**: `001-intro-physical-ai` | **Date**: 2025-12-06 | **Spec**: specs/001-intro-physical-ai/spec.md
**Plan**: specs/001-intro-physical-ai/plan.md

## Phase 1: Setup (Project Initialization)

- [ ] T001 Create physical-ai-book repository skeleton: physical-ai-book/ with docs/, sidebars.js, docusaurus.config.js, package.json

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

- [X] T002 [US1] Define Physical AI and motivate humanoid robotics: docs/intro.md
- [X] T003 [US2] Outline course roadmap and list 3 learning outcomes: docs/intro.md
- [X] T004 [US3] Create Mermaid flowchart "Digital AI → Physical AI → Humanoid Robotics": docs/intro.md

## Dependencies

- T002 depends on T001
- T003 depends on T002
- T004 depends on T003

## Parallel Execution Examples

(Not applicable for this module as tasks are sequential documentation creation)

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will focus on sequential documentation creation, ensuring each section builds upon the previous one. Each task will involve writing content to `docs/intro.md` to fulfill the specification requirements.
